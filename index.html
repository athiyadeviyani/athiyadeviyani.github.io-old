          <a href="https://athiyadeviyani.github.io">Hello!</a></h1>

        <p>
            My name is Athiya Deviyani, but you can call me Tia.
            <br>
            <br> I am a second year Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science student at The University of Edinburgh.
            <br>
            <br> I am currently developing the website for the <a href="https://www.ppiedinburgh.org">Indonesian Students’ Association in Edinburgh</a>. My work focuses on the functionality of the website as well as the aesthetics, which means I do have quite a good eye for visual design. But don’t take my word for it, here’s my <a href="https://sway.office.com/moRCnz2QoO2xjGOa?ref=Link&loc=play">portfolio</a>.
            <br>
            <br> But I’ve worked on other projects as well, like the <a href="https://athiyadeviyani.github.io/PunGenerator/">Pun Generator</a> that I’ve been showing around to literally everyone. Last summer, I also worked on a <a href="https://github.com/athiyadeviyani/FacialRecognition">Facial Recognition System</a> for The Body Shop Indonesia, and I was really proud of how it turned out. You can also check out what I'm currently working on <a href="https://www.github.com/athiyadeviyani">here</a>.
            <br>
            <br> Most of the other projects I worked on are usually for <a href="https://devpost.com/athiyadeviyani">hackathons</a> - made under 36 hours with a lot of sugar and caffeine, and of course, my love for programming. If anyone can pull an all nighter and smash it, that would be me.
            <br>
            <br> Hey speaking of hackathons, I’m actually organizing one for next year! Do <a href="https://hacktheburgh.com/">check it out</a> if you’re interested. I promise it would be fun ;)
            <br>
            <br> Well that’s my brief introduction. If you're more into formal introductions, here's my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QYBG57s0fYHf77QpXYc3Qa4QlR8aVwbO/view?usp=sharing">CV</a>. If you clicked on it, might as well make it official - connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/athiyadeviyani/">LinkedIn</a>!
            <br>
            <br> Anything else? I'll be happy to <a href="mailto:athiyadee@gmail.com">talk</a> anytime.
            <br>
            <br> Cheers,
            <br>
            <br> Tia
